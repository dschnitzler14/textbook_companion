This website does not consider non-parametric tests to compare measures of central tendency (e.g., median value or average value) between groups for two reasons.  First, non-parametric tests involve (often unappreciated) assumptions that hinder analyses.  For example, researchers often use a Mann-Whitney U test to analyse data that fail to meet the assumptions of a t-test; here, researchers aim to evaluate evidence that the median values differ between the groups. 

This approach can be problematic, however, because Mann-Whitney U tests provide evidence for whether two distributions differ in general (i.e., including shape), not for whether median values differ between two distributions, specifically.  Therefore, if two distributions being compared differ in shape, then a small p-value might arise from a Mann-Whitney U test (at least in part) due to shape differences, and not due differences in median values. 

In other words, in order to use a Mann-Whitney U test to evaluate evidence for different median values between groups, the researcher must be confident that the two distributions have similar shapes.  Such unappreciated assumptions make non-parametric tests less desirable.  Second, non-parametric methods cannot provide meaningful estimates of effect size with appropriate uncertainty. 

As analyses of effect size offer more insight than those that focus on p-values (see Chapter 8: Abandon statistical significance, non-parametric tests have less to offer than alternative methods, such as computational approaches (randomization / permutation tests, bootstrapping).
